This was the final part of the Gizmo April Fools event. I put it on here so you can use it for whatever you want. I removed the Discord-related features so it works fine if you run it yourself.

## How do I play it?
Just download the source files and open index.html in your browser.

## What if I don't want to run it on my computer?
It's still hosted on the [Gizmo site](https://www.gizmo.moe/test/ram/index)

# NOTE: I didn't care about the code quality as I just wanted it to work ASAP so I'm aware of how awful it is.
